Optional Customizations
======
Here are a few changes I would recommend to make running queries and debugging much easier.

Alter Keyboard Shortcuts
------
[Instructional Page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/keyboard-shortcuts?view=sql-server-ver16)

I changed Run Query to _Command + Enter_ and Run Current Query to _Shift + Command + Enter_. Totally your preference, but I find this easier to remember.

Color Theme
------
Prefer dark mode or other custom system settings? _(Side note: I love Dark Mode, but when I record for this class I have to use Light Mode, so no judging!)_
Go to Color Theme under Settings and select your desired theme.

Utilize the Explorer
------
The Explorer allows you to open files directly from your system folders. 
1. Click on Explorer tab on the left side of your window (5th option down)
2. Select desired folder - I keep a folder specifically for this class
